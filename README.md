# 🌦️ Weather App

## 📘 Overview
This is a simple **React Weather App** that shows real-time weather information for any city in the world.  
It fetches live data using the **WeatherAPI** and displays temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed in an elegant interface.

## 🧠 Learning Topics
This project was created as part of my **Virtual Internship with HindukushSoft Technologies (Day 39 - Capstone Project)**  
Key learnings include:
- React `useState` Hook  
- Fetch API with `async/await`  
- Error handling and conditional rendering  
- Dynamic UI updates  
- Modern CSS design  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user enters a **city name** in the input field.  
2. On clicking **Search**, the app calls the **WeatherAPI** using this URL:  
https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=ea05112c7d79499fa89135627242312&q={city}&aqi=no

yaml
Copy code
3. If the city exists:
- The weather details are displayed (temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed).  
4. If the city name is invalid:
- The app shows an error message (`City not found!`).
